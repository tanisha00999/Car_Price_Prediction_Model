# Car Price Prediction Application

## Overview

This repository contains two applications for predicting car prices:
1. A Flask web application for car price prediction.
2. A Streamlit web application for car price prediction.

Both applications use a pre-trained Linear Regression model to predict car prices based on various features such as the year of the car, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and number of previous owners.

## Flask Web Application

### Features
- Predicts car prices based on user inputs.
- Uses a pre-trained Linear Regression model.

## Requirements
